pixel-ed - a not very functional SDL pixel editor

The problem with pixel editors (besides their not being available on
OpenBSD) is the same problem as Object Oriented code: all you wanted
was the banana, but you got the gorilla and the whole forest. Hence,
after some amount of effort, a pixel editor that does exactly what I
want, or maybe a lot less than that.

  doas pkg_add sdl2
  make
  ./pixel-ed out.bmp

  doas pkg_add ImageMagick
  display out.bmp

At present, there is not much more than "click on a palette color, then
click or drag in the edit cells to change colors". An attempt at saving
a bitmap is made when closing the program (via the "Q" key, or by
hitting the process with any of several different signals). Oh and to
use suitable flags for the grid size and whatnot or to otherwise TWEAK
the code where need be.


ALTERNATIVES

That were mentioned on the #openbsd-gaming IRC channel.

https://openports.se/graphics/mtpaint but gtk+3 (Gorilla To Kill)

krita - instead requires a Qt flavored Gorilla. And boost, etc.

https://github.com/justinmeiners/classic-colors but probably is tiny
on a high DPI monitor?

Any web-based pixel editor, but those require a bloat browser.
